# Housing price prediction using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

## Summary
Just wanted to perform a quick analysis using Tensorflow and Keras to make a prediction on the House Prices dataset. Many have done and contributed their exploratory data analyses in Kaggle. Based on these analyses, the focus here is to perform some quick data transformation and feature engineering, follow by model training and prediction. Finally, generating the submission csv for assessment in Kaggle.

I aim for this notebook to be short and not dwell in too much details on why certain parameters or models are selected. Purpose is to build a deep learning neural network model that perform well in making predictions on unseen data with optimal hyperparameters.
