# Housing price prediction using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

## Summary
Making a prediction on the Kaggle's Housing Price dataset using Machine Learning and Deep Learning approaches.  Details in the notebooks shared in the repository.

Many have done and contributed their exploratory data analyses in Kaggle. Based on these analyses, the focus here is to perform some quick data transformation and feature engineering, follow by model training and prediction. Finally, generating the submission csv for assessment in Kaggle.

I aim for the notebooks to be short and not dwell in too much details on why certain parameters or models are selected. Purpose is to build models that perform well in making predictions on unseen data with optimal hyperparameters.
